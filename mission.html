This pilgrimage will shed light to the atrocities that have been occurring within the Deserts, U.S.-Mexico Border, and our communities were people are suffering from injustice around the world. The terrorization of women and children through the separation of their mothers and fathers, the countless lives lost and signified by unmarked graves, and the inhumane treatment of people must end.  This march brings these realities to the forefront. A Trail for Humanity reminds us that we are all a reflection of one another –In Lak’ Ech Ala K’in. The attacks made on our documented, undocumented, and migrant brothers and sisters can no longer be silenced. We are all subject to the cruel systems of racism, sexism, and border and body politics that perpetuate violence. We are taking a stand against violence, especially the kind that target women and children. Join us in solidarity as we take a stand for humanity.
<blockquote>
"We invite all mothers and their children to join and lead the pilgrimage."

                            <li>Call for an end to the failed Secure Communities and 287g programs. a. Highlight the need for implementation of the California Trust Act as a way to ensure the safety of mothers and their citizen children are not separated.
                            </li>
                            <li>Shine a spotlight on Racial Profiling (such as “Gang Injunctions” that have filled the 33 state prisons to capacity. Seventeen of the thirty-three prisons are located in the San Joaquin Valley. All mothers and their children are invited to join and lead the pilgrimage calling for humane public policy.</li>
